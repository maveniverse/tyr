/**
 * Component responsible for config, remote repo URL and remote repo Auth extraction, while it follows various kinds
 * of "redirections".
 * <p>
 * User can set up proper environment by editing own, user wide <code>settings.xml</code>. Ideally (and minimally), user
 * should have as many auth-equipped server entries as much real publishing services user uses (for Central that is
 * today 3 + 1: Sonatype OSS, Sonatype S01, Sonatype Central Portal and ASF). Out of these four 2 are being phased
 * out (OSS and S01). Aside of auth, these entries should also contain Njord configuration such as
 * {@link SessionConfig#CONFIG_PUBLISHER},
 * {@link SessionConfig#CONFIG_RELEASE_URL} and optionally
 * {@link SessionConfig#CONFIG_SNAPSHOT_URL} if snapshot staging is desired. Once
 * user has these entries in own <code>settings.xml</code>, publishing is set up.
 * <p>
 * Historically, each OSS project "invented" their own Server ID in the <code>project/distributionManagement</code>,
 * so today we have many server IDs in use <em>despite almost all of use one of these 3 services to publish</em>.
 * (the Sonatype ones, so 3 and not 4, as ASF projects have all this sorted out by using ASF wide Parent POM).
 * This lead to issues, when one user maintains several "namespaces" (several unrelated groupID publishing to Central),
 * as this user needs to copy-paste all these server entries with <em>same auth</em> to be able to publish.
 * <p>
 * Take for example Sonatype Central Portal setup:
 * The recommended entry in user <code>settings.xml</code> is following (replace {@code $TOKEN1} and {@code $TOKEN2} with Central Portal generated tokens):
 * <pre>{@code
 *     <server>
 *       <id>sonatype-central-portal</id>
 *       <username>$TOKEN1</username>
 *       <password>$TOKEN2</password>
 *       <configuration>
 *         <njord.publisher>sonatype-cp</njord.publisher>
 *         <njord.releaseUrl>njord:template:release-sca</njord.releaseUrl>
 *       </configuration>
 *     </server>
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * The recommended POM distribution management entry for Central Portal w/ snapshot publishing enabled is this:
 * <pre>{@code
 *   <distributionManagement>
 *     <repository>
 *       <id>sonatype-central-portal</id>
 *       <name>Sonatype Central Portal</name>
 *       <url>https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/</url>
 *     </repository>
 *     <snapshotRepository>
 *       <id>sonatype-central-portal</id>
 *       <name>Sonatype Central Portal</name>
 *       <url>https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/</url>
 *     </snapshotRepository>
 *   </distributionManagement>
 * }</pre>
 * This entry tells the "truth", in a way it tells exactly where it publishes (URL), and it is from where the artifacts are available
 * once they are published. This latter is important, as before it was common to have some "service URL" here, that had nothing to
 * do with "published artifacts whereabouts", it was always implied. But, some tools like do like to have
 * this information, they should not guess this. Similarly for snapshot publishing, it is <em>same service</em>, hence
 * same auth is needed for it as well.
 * <p>
 * Moreover, consider if some vendor changes service endpoint (like goes Ver2 from Ver1). Having service endpoint in here
 * is not future-proof and is just confusing: your publishing target (Central) does not change but some technicality requires
 * you to change you parent POM. Using service endpoint does not express where the published artifacts will go.
 * Finally, all you do is <em>publish to Central</em>, so why should POM differ between two projects, possibly using
 * different services? Does it matter HOW you publish, while the WHERE you publish remain same? Is just silly.
 * <p>
 * Njord encourages this setup:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>have only as many properly identified auth-equipped entries in your <code>settings.xml</code> as many you really use (stop copy-paste, no duplicates)</li>
 *     <li>ideally, your POM should tell the "truth", and not use some invented server ID and service/proprietary URL</li>
 *     <li>if not possible, it allows you to create "redirects" in your <code>settings.xml</code> to overcome this chaos</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * In case you need to publish a project that does not follow these rules, and assuming it uses own invented server ID
 * "the-project-releases", but it migrated to use Central Portal, just add this entry to your user
 * <code>settings.xml</code>:
 * <pre>{@code
 *     <server>
 *       <id>the-project-releases</id>
 *       <configuration>
 *         <njord.serviceRedirect>sonatype-central-portal</njord.serviceRedirect>
 *       </configuration>
 *     </server>
 * }</pre>
 * And that is it, no copy pasta needed: if you cannot change the project distribution management, just redirect it
 * to proper service entry in your own <code>settings.xml</code>.
